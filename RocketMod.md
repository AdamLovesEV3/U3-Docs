Status
------

On the 20th of December 2019 Sven Mawby "fr34kyn01535" and Enes Sadık Özbek "Trojaner" officially ceased maintenance of RocketMod. They have released the source code under the MIT license. [Read their full farewell statement here.](https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket/blob/master/Farewell.md)

Unturned protects core Rocket compatibility between versions, so the final official Rocket.Unturned release should continue to function with all future releases of the game. Plugins may require updates, however.
