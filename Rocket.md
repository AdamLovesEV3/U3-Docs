# Rocket

__Rocket__ is a popular server-side plugin framework which expands the administrative toolset and wraps the Unturned APIs in a user-friendly manner. [Browse the open-source repository here.](https://github.com/SmartlyDressedGames/Legally-Distinct-Missile)

## Installation

The dedicated server includes a version maintained by SDG called Legally Distinct Missile or LDM. It exists to fix important issues that cropped up in the final release and preserve compatibility.

1. Copy the Rocket.Unturned module from the game's Extras directory.
2. Paste it into the game's Modules directory.

## Status

On the 20th of December 2019 Sven Mawby "fr34kyn01535" and Enes Sadık Özbek "Trojaner" officially ceased maintenance of RocketMod. They have kindly released the source code under the MIT license. [Read their full farewell statement here.](https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket/blob/master/Farewell.md)

Unturned protects core Rocket compatibility between versions, so it will continue to function with all future releases of the game. Plugins may require updates, however.
