Level Asset
===========

Each map can be associated with a **Level Asset**. These assets contain gameplay information not necessary for the main menus. Refer to [Level Config](LevelConfig.md) for information on linking a level asset to a map.

For examples check the `Assets/Levels` directory.

`Dropship_Prefab` [Master Bundle Pointer](MasterBundlePtr.md): Overrides the model seen flying over the map when a care package is dropped.

`Airdrop` [Asset Pointer](AssetPtr.md): to an [Airdrop Asset](AirdropAsset.md). Overrides the falling care package model.

This is an [Asset v2](AssetsV2.md) class.
